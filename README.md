## Context
TRJFP is a global movement aiming to abolish surplus food through a variety of Pay As You Feel concepts.

They work with international and local partners to intercept food destined for landfill and redistribute it through a network of Pay As You Feel Sharehouses, cafes and school partnerships.

## The App
The goal of this app is to verify drivers from TRJFP sent to pick up excess food from suppliers. There have been problems with drivers picking up food when they're not supposed to, or people impersonating TRJFP drivers in order to take and sell the food themselves.
Our main objectives are: 
- to make the supplier feel confident that they are giving food to the correct person
- to create a record of what drivers have been to which suppliers.

One request from the client is that we include a code that changes daily in order to help secure the verification.
